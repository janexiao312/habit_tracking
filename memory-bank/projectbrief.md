# Project Brief

Development of a personal habit tracking application using React TypeScript and Material-UI (MUI) that allows tracking of key health metrics including sleep hours, water intake, daily exercise, breaks taken, and standing count. The application will feature manual data entry through an intuitive UI with plans to integrate Apple Health API for automated data collection. Future iterations will include correlation analysis and visualization features.
