# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The personal habit tracking application is designed to help individuals monitor and improve their health metrics by tracking key habits such as sleep, water intake, exercise, breaks, and standing time. The goal is to provide users with insights into their daily habits and encourage healthier lifestyle choices.

## Problems It Solves
- Lack of awareness about daily health habits
- Difficulty in tracking multiple health metrics in one place
- Manual data entry can be tedious and error-prone
- Limited integration with health data from devices like Apple Health

## How It Should Work
The application should provide an intuitive user interface for manual data entry and display a daily overview of tracked habits. It should integrate with Apple Health to automate data collection and provide visualizations and insights based on the collected data.

## User Experience Goals
- Easy and quick data entry
- Clear and informative visualizations
- Seamless integration with Apple Health
- Personalized insights and recommendations
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
