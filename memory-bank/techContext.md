# Technical Context

## Project Overview
Development of a personal habit tracking application using React TypeScript and Material-UI (MUI) that allows tracking of key health metrics including sleep hours, water intake, daily exercise, breaks taken, and standing count. The application will feature manual data entry through an intuitive UI with plans to integrate Apple Health API for automated data collection. Future iterations will include correlation analysis and visualization features.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Component Library**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js or Chart.js
- **Health Data Integration**: Apple HealthKit API
- **Local Storage**: IndexedDB or localStorage
- **Data Export**: JSON/CSV export functionality

## Core Features

### Phase 1: MVP
1. **Habit Tracking Dashboard**
   - Daily input forms for:
     - Sleep hours (duration and quality)
     - Water intake (glasses/ml)
     - Exercise (type, duration, intensity)
     - Breaks taken (frequency and duration)
     - Standing count (times and duration)
   - Daily overview display

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Basic charts for individual metrics
   - Weekly and monthly summaries
   - Progress indicators

3. **Data Management**
   - Local storage integration
   - Data export functionality
   - Data backup and restore options

### Phase 2: Apple Health Integration
1. **HealthKit API Integration**
   - Device permissions management
   - Data synchronization for:
     - Sleep tracking
     - Exercise data
     - Standing information

2. **Data Reconciliation**
   - Merging manual entries with Apple Health data
   - Conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Data validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
1. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Cross-metric correlation visualization
   - Trend identification
   - Personalized insights

2. **Reporting Features**
   - Customizable reports
   - Goal setting and achievement tracking
   - Recommendation engine

## Technical Considerations

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface HabitEntry {
  date: Date;
  sleepHours: number;
  sleepQuality?: number; // 1-10 scale
  waterIntake: number; // in ml or oz
  exercise: {
    type: string;
    duration: number; // minutes
    intensity?: number; // 1-10 scale
  }[];
  breaks: {
    time: Date;
    duration: number; // minutes
  }[];
  standingCount: number;
  standingDuration?: number; // minutes
}
```

### Apple HealthKit Integration
- Research and implement the HealthKit JS bridge for React Native Web or alternative solutions for web applications
- Handle permission requests and data privacy compliance
- Implement regular sync intervals and conflict resolution

### UI/UX Design Principles
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Intuitive data entry forms with validation
- Dark/light mode support
