# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns between different components. The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, and the UI components are styled using Material-UI (MUI). State management is handled using Redux or Context API, and data visualization is implemented using D3.js or Chart.js. The application integrates with Apple HealthKit API for health data synchronization and uses MongoDB for data persistence, with Mongoose as the ODM (Object Document Mapper) and Express.js for the backend API.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **React with TypeScript**: Chosen for its strong typing and component-based architecture, which enhances code maintainability and scalability.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Selected for its comprehensive set of pre-built UI components and customization capabilities.
- **Redux or Context API**: Used for state management to ensure a predictable and centralized state across the application.
- **D3.js or Chart.js**: Utilized for data visualization to create interactive and informative charts.
- **Apple HealthKit API**: Integrated to automate data collection from health devices and provide a seamless user experience.
- **MongoDB**: Selected for its flexible document model and scalability, making it ideal for storing varied habit tracking data.
- **Mongoose**: Chosen as the ODM to provide schema validation and type safety when working with MongoDB.
- **Express.js**: Used to build a RESTful API backend that connects the React frontend with MongoDB.

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is built using reusable and self-contained components, which promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- **State Management**: The application uses Redux or Context API to manage the global state, ensuring a consistent and predictable state across different components.
- **Data Visualization**: The application leverages D3.js or Chart.js to create dynamic and interactive charts that provide valuable insights to users.
- **API Integration**: The application integrates with external APIs, such as Apple HealthKit, to enhance functionality and provide a seamless user experience.

## Component Relationships
- **Habit Tracking Dashboard**: The main component that displays the daily input forms and overview of tracked habits.
- **Data Entry Forms**: Sub-components for each habit metric (sleep, water intake, exercise, breaks, standing count) that allow users to input their data.
- **Data Visualization**: Components that render charts and graphs for individual metrics, weekly and monthly summaries, and progress indicators.
- **Data Management**: Components responsible for local storage integration, data export functionality, and data backup and restore options.
- **Apple Health Integration**: Components that handle device permissions, data synchronization, and data reconciliation with Apple HealthKit.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Components that perform correlation analysis, trend identification, and generate personalized insights and reports.
