# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on setting up the memory bank for the personal habit tracking application. This includes documenting the project brief, product context, technical context, system patterns, and progress.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to outline the core requirements and goals of the project.
- Created `productContext.md` to explain why the project exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and the user experience goals.
- Created `techContext.md` to detail the technical aspects of the project, including the technology stack, core features, technical considerations, and weekly task breakdown.
- Created `systemPatterns.md` to describe the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, and component relationships.
- Created `progress.md` to document the current status and known issues.
- Initialized React TypeScript project with MUI and started the development server.
- Created `HabitForm` component and integrated it into the home page.
- Created Redux store and habit slice for state management.

## Next Steps
- Set up project structure and coding standards.
- Create basic navigation and layout components.
- Design and implement habit tracking dashboard UI.
- Set up local storage mechanism.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensure all memory bank files are comprehensive and up-to-date.
- Maintain clarity and precision in documentation to support future development efforts.
