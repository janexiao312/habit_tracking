# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on transitioning from local storage to MongoDB for data persistence. MongoDB has been installed and configured, with necessary database connection setup in place.

## Recent Changes
- Installed and configured MongoDB (Community Edition 7.0)
- Set up MongoDB connection configuration in backend/config/db.js
- Added environment variables for MongoDB connection
- Updated gitignore to handle MongoDB files and environment variables
- Updated technical documentation to reflect MongoDB integration

## Next Steps
- Create Mongoose models for habit data
- Implement backend API routes for CRUD operations
- Update frontend to use MongoDB through API instead of local storage
- Add data migration script to move existing data from local storage to MongoDB

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensure all memory bank files are comprehensive and up-to-date.
- Maintain clarity and precision in documentation to support future development efforts.
